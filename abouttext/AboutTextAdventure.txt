A simple HTML adventure game that has a 4-step puzzle mechanic for the player to solve using text commands. The player embarks on a journey to find the treasure hidden in this secret temple. Watch out for traps. Few words and grammatical structures in the dialogs are completely butchered on purpose in order to give the adventure a weird sense of humor.
