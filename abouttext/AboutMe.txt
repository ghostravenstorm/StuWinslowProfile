Writing code and working on the technical backend is what I am best at. What I currently do now started out as a hobby learning how to write mods for Minecraft and addons for other titles. I currently attend University of Central Florida seeking a BA in Digital Media: Game Design which I hope to turn into a full career. 

Talents:
- Code anaysis, breakdown, and implementation
- Technical writing and documentation
- Hardware nutcase
