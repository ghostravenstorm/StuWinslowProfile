This is a very simple interactive graphic that tracks the mouse cursor and redirects Mr. Oogle's eyes towards it. This was part of a class final which our challege was to examine a GIF of what the instructor had made and we has to attempt to copy the behavior and write our own code for it. 

This version is actaully a second iteration of the project. A friend approched me asking for help with the class I had already taken, so I offered my services. I saw this as a great opportunity to teach my friend the fundamentals code organization and to actaully improve upon my own code here. This second time writing code for the same project I certainly was able to write far more efficently that I had before identifying my own mistakes inteh first one and using them as an example to show my friend.

This was made using Processing. For more info about Processing check out Processing.org.
