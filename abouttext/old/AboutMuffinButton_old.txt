The Muffin Button is my favorite Processing sketch just because of how simple and amusing it is. What does it do? 

It. Makes. Muffins. 

Have you ever had that moment in the morning where you just woke up and you're hungry, so you want a simple button to press that makes a muffin? Unfortunately I am not capable of such mad science... yet... but I wanted to do something close to the concept so I coded a muffin button. The inspiration behind muffin button came from a video series on YouTube called DragonBall Z Abridged where the main character, Goku, is on a space ship which has a muffin button. 

At the time when I was playing around with Processing learning more about it since it was required to be used in one of my classes, I wanted to explore more of its functions and see if I can get external images to be pasted onto the canvas. This was a test to see if I can code a function to bring in external images to the Processing API so that I can apply it to 2D games. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to images into Ship Game, which is why every object in that game is a circle; even the background. Ship Game had other technical troubleshooting I had attend to first before graphics.

This was made in Processing. For more info about Processing check out `Processing.org`.
