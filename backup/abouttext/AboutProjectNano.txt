Project.nano is a 2D "hacking" game that I made with a team in DIG 4713 Game Design as our final project. The game features a unquie mechanic which the user must use text-based commands to manipulate the environment and solve puzzles to reach the end. 

# Instructions
- Use tab to toggle Nano's visor to type in commands.
- Use W, A, S, D to move Nano.
- Use Q and E to cycle through multiple access points in range.

# Hints
- The green circle is Nano's detection range and health indicator.
- Not all nodes that appear in Nano's visor need commands to be typed.
- The game does not pause when Nano has her visor down. Be quick!
- Some security nodes have multiple layers.
- Nano's health goes back to full after each room.
